          With an academic background in Political Science, I gradually became
          involved in the world of technology and software â€” first through Data
          Science, and later by training in the fascinating field of Software
          Development.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Today, I am a full stack developer passionate about building complete
          web applications with clean interfaces and efficient backends. I enjoy
          learning new technologies and applying them to projects that have a
          real impact. I'm currently focused on React, Node.js, and databases,
          exploring the integration of front-end and back-end solutions.
          However, I also have experience with Python and Java.
